### Send an SMS

This example shows you how to send an SMS to your chosen number.

First, [sign up for a Vonage account](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up) if you don't already have one, and make a note of your API key and secret on the [dashboard getting started page](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/getting-started-guide).

## Troubleshooting

If you have problems when making API calls be sure to check the returned [status field](/messaging/sms/guides/troubleshooting-sms) for specific [error codes](/messaging/sms/guides/troubleshooting-sms#sms-api-error-codes).

## Concepts

Before using the Vonage SMS API, familiarize yourself with the following:

* **[Number format](/voice/voice-api/guides/numbers)** - The SMS API requires phone numbers in E.164 format.

* **[Authentication](/concepts/guides/authentication)** - The SMS API authenticates using your account API key and secret.

* **[Webhooks](/concepts/guides/webhooks)** - The SMS API makes HTTP requests to your application web server so that you can act upon them. For example: inbound SMS and delivery receipts.
